# matlab-hangman
# •	A MATLAB terminal based game that functions the same way the everyday game hangman works.
# •	This system allows user to input a desired difficulty through the terminal and randomly picks through a selection of words on the selected difficulty, each difficulty # # # # resembles a number of characters for each word in the given selection.
# •	The user has to guess what the word is by inputting letters. If letter is correct, it fills the incomplete string with letters, if letter is wrong, the number of attempts # # left will be decreased. If the user inputs 6 incorrect letters, they lose the game and the program stops.
# •	Written all possible test cases for each component and outlining which inputs crash the system and inputs that are functional.
